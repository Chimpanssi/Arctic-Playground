The popular winter themed VR sandbox game, first showcased in Vectorama, now published for anyone to play on their own Oculus devices.
The game had some last minute changes before Vectorama when issues showed up, and they most likely aren't in this version. If you happen to find any bugs or glitches in this version of the game, contact me through my e-mail about them. (antti.aho356@gmail.com)
