# Arctic-Playground
The popular winter themed VR sandbox game, first showcased in Vectorama, now published for anyone to play on their own Oculus devices.
The game had some last minute changes before Vectorama when issues showed up, and they most likely aren't in this version. If you happen to find any bugs or glitches in this version of the game, or want something to be added, contact me through my e-mail about it. (antti.aho356@gmail.com)

# How to play
By putting your hand on the ground and grabbing, you get a snowball in your hand.
You can roll it on the ground to increase the snowball's size.
With any object in your hand, you can pull the trigger on your controller to connect it to the ground or another object, so it will stay in place until grabbed.

By throwing snowballs at the targets, you can get two different molds to create snow cubes by placing snowballs inside of them.
The first mold is obtained after you hit 3 targets, the second one is obtained after you hit 6 targets.
You can rip a snow cube in half by pulling it apart with your hands. This will give you a smaller building object, and this process can be repeated as many times as you want to get even smaller objects.

The map contains a box with objects used for decorating snowmen. These can be grabbed and attached to your snowmen just like any other object.
